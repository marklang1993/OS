My first OS project on Intel x86 architecture. I am still considering a good name for it, but I just call it "Mark's OS" currently.

This is a microkernel OS, and I am writing it with some references to Orange's, Minix and xv6.

It does not finish, but I plan to pause the development currently since I will be back to campus and continue to my academic term soon.

- To do list

1. Hard drive driver;
2. Support FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 and xv6 filesystem;
3. Use filesystem to build a complete driver framework;
4. Improve paging mechanism and add virtual memory management;
5. Enter into the stage of graphics interfaces.

- Way to build:

Simply pull the whole repo and install the lastest bochs.
Make and run by typing "make run".
